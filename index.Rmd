# Course Description {#description}

One of the most important areas of research in political science concerns the development of modern democracy. For most of recorded history, human beings have lived under dictatorship. During the 20th century, however, democracy swept the globe. While democracy is now a “zeitgeist,” most regimes still fail to meet the minimum standards to be labeled “democratic”. Likewise, many democracies are currently under threat from illiberal and anti-pluralist forces. This semester, we will tackle questions about what constitutes democracy and what explains democratization. We will discuss core debates in the academic literature, drawing on modern classics and newer works produced in the last five years. These scholarly works are highly relevant not only to scholars of democratization but to policymakers and practitioners. Therefore, the course content should be helpful for graduate students pursuing academic careers and those contemplating more policy-oriented professions.

---  

# Student Learning Objectives {#slos}

By the end of the semester, you should be able to... 

1. Summarize the main arguments and findings in the scholarly literature on democratization.
2. Synthesize the scholarly literature on democratization to identify how different arguments and findings speak to one another. 
3. Evaluate the current state of our knowledge about democratization to identify limitations and new areas for research.

# Course Requirements



## 1. Class Discussion (50\%) {#discussion}

This is a seminar, not a lecture-based course. You are expected to attend and participate in all scheduled class meetings. You should arrive on time, having completed the assigned readings, and prepared to summarize, synthesize, and evaluate the material. This means that you need to actively engage with the required readings before class, asking questions such as:

* What is the research *question* guiding this work? 
* What *methods* are used to answer the research question? 
* What are the main findings or *conclusions* from this research? 
* How does this research *relate* to other scholarly works in the literature? 
* What are the core *contributions* of this work? 
* What are the *limitations* of this research? 

I strongly encourage you to prepare notes on the readings and bring them to class.

**Discussion Questions**: To facilitate class discussions, you are required to submit at least two discussion questions each week **by 8am the day of class**, which can be of a conceptual, substantive, or critical nature. Generally, we will follow that order but may deviate depending on the flow of the discussion.

**Earning Discussion Credit**: For each class session, you can earn up to five points toward your class discussion grade. One point is for submitting two well-formulated discussion questions by 8am, and the other four are for active participation during the discussion. You will not earn discussion credit for merely attending class. You may also lose discussion credit if you arrive to class late, or I suspect that you are not actively listening to the discussion (e.g., working on other assignments, doom scrolling) since this is disrespectful and potentially distracting. It is possible to earn a negative discussion credit score for the day.



## 2. Exam or Project (50\%) {#exam}

**For Students who will take the comparative politics comprehensive exam**

To help you prepare for comprehensive exams, you will take a practice and final exam covering the content of this course. I will grade you exam based on your demonstrated ability to (1) summarize the readings; (2) synthesize across the readings; and (3) evaluate and critique the readings, such as by discussing the limitations, problems in the research design, or flaws in the core argument. These are the same criteria the comparative politics faculty uses when evaluating comprehensive exam responses. We will have a practice exam around the midterm and the final exam will take place during the final week of classes.  If you fail the final exam, you will have one opportunity to re-take it during the university scheduled final exam period. 

**Students who have already taken or will not take the comparative politics comprehensive exam**

You will conduct a research project. Your project may either be an original research paper, a research proposal, or a policy brief. The project should be related to democratization (broadly defined) and fit within your research or policy interests. Original papers can serve as starting points for article manuscripts, dissertation or thesis chapters, conference presentations, and writing samples. Research proposals will help you refine an idea and get feedback on it, which can be used for a dissertation or thesis prospectus. Policy briefs will provide those interested in policy-oriented careers a chance to engage with the policy implications of the academic work we read throughout the course and develop a viable writing sample for job applications.

# Attendance Policy {#excuses}

Students are expected to attend all scheduled class meetings. A student may miss class only for good cause and must provide written documentation in advance or within **48 hours** of the missed class or as soon as physically possible.

Good cause for missing class, subject to the professor's discretion, may include:

* Sickness which disables the student from attending class or poses a significant threat to the health of others
* Sickness of, or accident involving, a spouse or dependent, that requires the student to be with the spouse or dependent
* An accident which necessarily prevents the student’s attendance in class 
* The death of a family member or friend
* An interview for an internship or a permanent position after graduation, if the interview cannot reasonably be scheduled to avoid a conflict
* A meeting or event at which the student must appear as a representative of the University (including official athletic events)
* Comprehensive exams, where the department schedules these to take place on the same day, one day before, or one day after the class meeting
* Jury duty on the same day as the class meeting
* Other good cause as is warranted under the circumstances 

Deadlines for other course assignments do not constitute a good cause for missing class. Extracurriculars (including Greek Life) are also not generally acceptable excuses for absences unless the student is acting as an official representative of the University (e.g., mock trial tournaments and official athletic events). 


## Excessive Absences ##

A student who is absent *for any reason* from the equivalent of three class meetings will only be allowed to continue with the course if they obtain approval from the professor. In such circumstances, the student will be marked as failing the course with an “F” letter grade unless they withdraw from the course before the final grading period.

--- 

# Grading Policies {#grades}


We will use the following grading scale in this class. Graduate students must maintain a 3.0 cumulative GPA or higher for all graduate coursework taken at the University of Alabama. A minimum 3.0 GPA is also required to be eligible for funding from the department.  

|      A (4.0)     |     B (3.0)      |       C (2.0)      |      F   (0.0)      |
| :---------: |  :-------:  |  :----------: |  :------------:| 
|  Exemplary  | Adequate    |  Inadequate   |  Insufficient  |
| 90-100\%    | 75-89\%     |  50-74\%      |  0-49\%        |



## Missed Exams & Coursework {#late}

As a general rule, I do not accept late work. Deadlines on the [Course Schedule](schedule.html) are there to help ensure you successfully achieve the student learning objectives by the end of the semester. If you cannot meet a deadline or will need to miss an exam for a good cause, you must provide written documentation within  **48 hours** of the missed assignment or as soon as physically possible. 



## Grade Disputes {#disputes}

If you think I have made an error, contact me during office hours or schedule an appointment within one week of receiving the grade. Out of respect for your right to privacy under the University’s Confidentiality of Student Records policy and the Family Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, I do not discuss grades via email.



## Incomplete Grades {#incomplete}

Incomplete “I” grades will be recorded only in exceptional cases when: the student (a) has completed a substantial portion of the course and is otherwise passing, (b) is unable to complete a well-defined portion of a course for reasons beyond the student’s control, and (c) in the instructor’s judgment  can complete the required work without repeating the course. 

The University of Alabama policy requires all grades of “I” to be removed no later than 12 months after the end of the term in which they were awarded but prior to the student’s graduation or the grade of “I” will be changed to an “F.” The “I” may not be used as a means to re-enroll in a course during a subsequent semester. A grade of “I” may not be used to satisfy a prerequisite requirement.

Requests for "I" grades must be submitted in writing to the instructor using this form: https://forms.gle/JWRZz87gmhyLmBdr9. Such requests can be sent no earlier than 01 November 2023 (the last day to drop a course with a "W") and no later than 12:30pm on 11 December 2023 (the end of the final exam period).

# Plagiarism and AI Technology

Learning to communicate your ideas effectively is an essential skill for any career path you may eventually take after graduation. While AI technology is exciting and offers opportunities to improve the efficiency of our research and writing, misusing this technology has negative consequences. Bots like ChatGPT are only accurate about 60-70% of the time and have been known to fabricate information. Using these tools to write your work for you is not only unethical, it renders you invisible. Your voice matters! Don’t let an AI silence you.

In line with UA’s Academic Misconduct policy, I expect you to generate your own work in this course. By submitting an assignment, you claim this work is entirely your own. Any work that you have paraphrased should be correctly cited. If you use more than three words in a row from someone else’s work, use quotation marks and cite the source, including the page number. We will use the American Political Science Association’s (APSA) style manual to assist with this endeavor, accessible here: https://connect.apsanet.org/stylemanual/.

If you submit work generated by someone else or created by a computer application such as ChatGPT, this will be considered a violation of the Academic Misconduct policy and may be reported to the Department Chair or Dean’s office for review.

You may use word processing tools to check your spelling and grammar and assist with simple re-phrasing tasks. For example, I use the Grammarly application to help with my writing. It checks spelling and punctuation and sometimes provides advice on rephrasing sentences for clarity. This is a perfectly acceptable use of technology. However, having Grammarly’s AI assistant or similar tools write your work for you is unacceptable.
