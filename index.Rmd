# Course Description {#description}

One of the most important areas of research in political science concerns the development of modern democracy. For most of recorded history, human beings have lived under dictatorship. During the 20th century, however, democracy swept the globe. While democracy is now a “zeitgeist,” most regimes still fail to meet the minimum standards to be labeled “democratic”. Likewise, many democracies are currently under threat from illiberal and anti-pluralist forces. This semester, we will tackle questions about what constitutes democracy and what explains democratization. We will discuss core debates in the academic literature, drawing on modern classics and newer works produced in the last five years. These scholarly works are highly relevant not only to scholars of democratization but to policymakers and practitioners. Throughout this semester, you will also learn how to employ the "structured focused comparison" method for case studies. This method allows investigators to analyze historical processes in a systematic way to draw meaningful conclusions about how institutional changes unfold. The course content should be helpful for graduate students pursuing academic careers and those contemplating more policy-oriented professions.

---  

# Student Learning Objectives {#slos}

By the end of the semester, you should be able to... 

1. Summarize the main arguments and findings in the scholarly literature on democratization.
2. Synthesize the scholarly literature on democratization to identify how different arguments and findings speak to one another. 
3. Evaluate the current state of our knowledge about democratization to identify limitations and new areas for research. 
4. Apply the structured focused comparison approach to evaluate processes of democratization and their divergent outcomes using real-world cases.

# Course Requirements



## 1. Class Discussion (50\%) {#discussion}

This is a seminar, not a lecture-based course. You are expected to attend and participate in all scheduled class meetings. You should arrive on time, having completed the assigned readings, and prepared to summarize, synthesize, and evaluate the material. This means that you need to actively engage with the required readings before class, asking questions such as:

* What is the research *question* guiding this work? 
* What *methods* are used to answer the research question? 
* What are the main findings or *conclusions* from this research? 
* How does this research *relate* to other scholarly works in the literature? 
* What are the core *contributions* of this work? 
* What are the *limitations* of this research? 

I strongly encourage you to prepare notes on the readings and bring them to class.

**Discussion Questions**: To facilitate class discussions, you are required to submit at least two discussion questions each week **by 8am the day of class**, which can be of a conceptual, substantive, or critical nature. Generally, we will follow that order but may deviate depending on the flow of the discussion.

**Earning Discussion Credit**: For each class session, you can earn up to five points toward your class discussion grade. One point is for submitting two well-formulated discussion questions by 8am, and the other four are for active participation during the discussion. You will not earn discussion credit for merely attending class. You may also lose discussion credit if you arrive to class late, or I suspect that you are not actively listening to the discussion (e.g., working on other assignments, doom scrolling) since this is disrespectful and potentially distracting. It is possible to earn a negative discussion credit score for the day.



## 2. Final Paper (50\%) 

You will be assigned two cases to analyze for structured focused comparison. This method for case study research uses the systematic selection of cases and the application of a standard set of criteria to evaluate the historical processes in each case to achieve the overall research objective. Our research objective is to better understand democratization. To do so, we will look at cases where political liberalization did and did not produce a democratic transition. We will focus on explaining "deviant" cases where the outcome we observed was different from what we expected *a priori* by comparing them to other cases that are similar or different. You will complete the project in several stages, with feedback and opportunities for revisions throughout. At the end of the semester, you will present your findings to the class for comments and discussion. Here is a summary of the deadlines, which can also be found in the Course Schedule. 


| Assignment                        | Deadline              |
|:------------------------------------| :----------------------|
| Timeline of events and references   | 03 October 2023 (11:59pm) |
| Draft "deviant" case study          | 24 October 2023 (11:59pm) |
| Draft final paper                   | 28 November 2023 (11:59pm) |
| Final presentations                 | 05 December (1-3:30pm) |
| Final papers                        | 11 December 2023 (12:30pm) |

# Attendance Policy {#excuses}

Students are expected to attend all scheduled class meetings. A student may miss class only for good cause and must provide written documentation in advance or within **48 hours** of the missed class or as soon as physically possible.

Good cause for missing class, subject to the professor's discretion, may include:

* Sickness which disables the student from attending class or poses a significant threat to the health of others
* Sickness of, or accident involving, a spouse or dependent, that requires the student to be with the spouse or dependent
* An accident which necessarily prevents the student’s attendance in class 
* The death of a family member or friend
* An interview for an internship or a permanent position after graduation, if the interview cannot reasonably be scheduled to avoid a conflict
* A meeting or event at which the student must appear as a representative of the University (including official athletic events)
* Comprehensive exams, where the department schedules these to take place on the same day, one day before, or one day after the class meeting
* Jury duty on the same day as the class meeting
* Other good cause as is warranted under the circumstances 

Deadlines for other course assignments do not constitute a good cause for missing class. Extracurriculars (including Greek Life) are also not generally acceptable excuses for absences unless the student is acting as an official representative of the University (e.g., mock trial tournaments and official athletic events). 


## Excessive Absences ##

A student who is absent *for any reason* from the equivalent of three class meetings will only be allowed to continue with the course if they obtain approval from the professor. In such circumstances, the student will be marked as failing the course with an “F” letter grade unless they withdraw from the course before the final grading period.

--- 

# Grading Policies {#grades}


We will use the following grading scale in this class. Graduate students must maintain a 3.0 cumulative GPA or higher for all graduate coursework taken at the University of Alabama. A minimum 3.0 GPA is also required to be eligible for funding from the department.  

|      A (4.0)     |     B (3.0)      |       C (2.0)      |      F   (0.0)      |
| :---------: |  :-------:  |  :----------: |  :------------:| 
|  Exemplary  | Adequate    |  Inadequate   |  Insufficient  |
| 90-100\%    | 75-89\%     |  50-74\%      |  0-49\%        |



## Missed Exams & Coursework {#late}

As a general rule, I do not accept late work. Deadlines on the [Course Schedule](schedule.html) are there to help ensure you successfully achieve the student learning objectives by the end of the semester. If you cannot meet a deadline or will need to miss an exam for a good cause, you must provide written documentation within  **48 hours** of the missed assignment or as soon as physically possible. 



## Grade Disputes {#disputes}

If you think I have made an error, contact me during office hours or schedule an appointment within one week of receiving the grade. Out of respect for your right to privacy under the University’s Confidentiality of Student Records policy and the Family Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, I do not discuss grades via email.



## Incomplete Grades {#incomplete}

Incomplete “I” grades will be recorded only in exceptional cases when: the student (a) has completed a substantial portion of the course and is otherwise passing, (b) is unable to complete a well-defined portion of a course for reasons beyond the student’s control, and (c) in the instructor’s judgment  can complete the required work without repeating the course. 

The University of Alabama policy requires all grades of “I” to be removed no later than 12 months after the end of the term in which they were awarded but prior to the student’s graduation or the grade of “I” will be changed to an “F.” The “I” may not be used as a means to re-enroll in a course during a subsequent semester. A grade of “I” may not be used to satisfy a prerequisite requirement.

Requests for "I" grades must be submitted in writing to the instructor using this form: https://forms.office.com/r/1wFD67LTPn. Such requests can be sent no earlier than 01 November 2023 (the last day to drop a course with a "W") and no later than 12:30pm on 11 December 2023 (the end of the final exam period).

# Plagiarism and AI Technology

Learning to communicate your ideas effectively is an essential skill for any career path you may eventually take after graduation. While AI technology is exciting and offers opportunities to improve the efficiency of our research and writing, misusing this technology has negative consequences. Bots like ChatGPT are only accurate about 60-70% of the time and have been known to fabricate information. Using these tools to write your work for you is not only unethical, it renders you invisible. Your voice matters! Don’t let an AI silence you.

In line with UA’s Academic Misconduct policy, I expect you to generate your own work in this course. By submitting an assignment, you claim this work is entirely your own. Any work that you have paraphrased should be correctly cited. If you use more than three words in a row from someone else’s work, use quotation marks and cite the source, including the page number. We will use the American Political Science Association’s (APSA) style manual to assist with this endeavor, accessible here: https://connect.apsanet.org/stylemanual/.

If you submit work generated by someone else or created by a computer application such as ChatGPT, this will be considered a violation of the Academic Misconduct policy and may be reported to the Department Chair or Dean’s office for review.

You may use word processing tools to check your spelling and grammar and assist with simple re-phrasing tasks. For example, I use the Grammarly application to help with my writing. It checks spelling and punctuation and sometimes provides advice on rephrasing sentences for clarity. This is a perfectly acceptable use of technology. However, having Grammarly’s AI assistant or similar tools write your work for you is unacceptable.

# Controversial Topics

Some of the topics in this course may be considered controversial. One of the core purposes of a university is to discuss important topics through a scholarly lens. When members of a class find themselves feeling strongly about a topic, that is a signal that the topic is important enough to be discussed rather than avoided. Differences of opinion are expected and will result in rich discussions. In these discussions students will be expected to demonstrate a thorough understanding of concepts presented in the course materials and to ground their positions in concepts and evidence relevant to the course. This in turn will entail coming to class prepared, asking relevant questions, sharing perspectives, having a willingness to listen, and practicing open-mindedness when encountering the perspectives of others. In this course we will assume the positive intentions of all class members when discussing important topics, and we will give them the benefit of the doubt when considering their perspectives and sharing our own. 

---  

# Other Policies

## Names and Pronouns 

UA provides instructors with a roster listing each student’s legal name. However, I will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise me accordingly early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records. You can also designate your pronouns in Banner.



## TurnItin Policy

## Audio/Video Recordings

This is an in-person discussion-based seminar. Therefore, as a general rule, no one is allowed to make audio or video recordings of our class sessions. This will facilitate an active, honest, open discussion during our meetings.  Any student violating this rule may be referred to the Office of Student Conduct for disciplinary action. Students with documented disabilities requiring access to audio recordings of missed classes should notify me formally through the ODS portal so that we can make alternative accommodations that are more reasonable for the course format.



## Sharing Course Materials

All course materials, presentations, and class discussions are only for viewing by members of this class section. They may not be posted in any public forum or shared with anyone not enrolled. Any student violating these rules may be referred to the Office of Student Conduct for disciplinary action.


## Academic Misconduct 

Students are expected to be familiar with and adhere to the official Academic Misconduct Policy provided in the Online Catalog. Any suspected academic misconduct, including plagiarism, will be referred to the College of Arts & Sciences Dean’s Office.  For more information: https://provost.ua.edu/academic-misconduct/
