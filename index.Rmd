# Course Description {#description}

Africa is a diverse continent made up of 54 countries and over 1.2 billion people.  The land area of the Gambia is smaller than Connecticut, whereas Algeria and D.R. Congo are both larger than Western Europe. With over 200 million residents, Nigeria is home to nearly 3\% of the world’s population. Meanwhile, all the residents of Seychelles could fit inside Bryant Denny Stadium (with room to spare!). The continent is often depicted as an impoverished place. To some extent this is true – currently, fifteen African countries have a GDP per capita (PPP) under \$2,000. At the same time, Botswana’s GDP per capita (PPP) is nearly \$2,000 higher than China’s. Africa is also home to all types of political systems – this includes a thriving liberal democracy in Ghana, an absolute monarchy in Eswatini, a military junta in Sudan, and a one-party regime in Eritrea. This makes Africa an exciting place to study comparative politics.

This course primarily focuses on contemporary political dynamics on the African continent in the post-Cold War period.  We will situate studies about African cases within the broader debates of comparative politics by focusing on several core research areas within the sub-discipline. We will draw extensively from recently published books and journal articles throughout the semester to learn about the latest scholarship on African Politics.

# Student Learning Objectives {#slos}

By the end of the semester, you should be able to... 

1.	Summarize the main arguments and findings in the scholarly literature on African Politics.
2.	Synthesize the scholarly literature on African Politics to identify how different arguments and findings speak to one another. 
3.	Evaluate the current state of our knowledge about African Politics to identify limitations and new areas for research.

# Course Requirements



## 1. Class Discussion (50\%) {#discussion}

This is a seminar, not a lecture-based course. You are expected to attend and participate in all scheduled class meetings. You should arrive on time, having completed the assigned readings, and prepared to summarize, synthesize, and evaluate the material. This means that you need to actively engage with the required readings before class, asking questions such as:

* What is the research *question* guiding this work? 
* What *methods* are used to answer the research question? 
* What are the main findings or *conclusions* from this research? 
* How does this research *relate* to other scholarly works in the literature? 
* What are the core *contributions* of this work? 
* What are the *limitations* of this research? 

I strongly encourage you to prepare notes on the readings and bring them to class. For each class session, you can earn up to five points toward your class discussion grade:

**Discussion Questions (1 point)**: To facilitate class discussions, you are required to submit at least two discussion questions each week **by 8am the day of class**. Your questions should critically engage with and strive to build connections between the assigned readings, both within individual weeks and across the entire course. This means that you should prepare accordingly. Your questions will be evaluated based on their quality and you will not earn points for questions that lack sufficient depth or engagement with the assigned materials. 

**In-Class Participation (4 points)**: Active participation during the discussion means that you are *listening* and *engaging* with others. You will not earn discussion credit for merely attending class. You may also lose discussion credit if you arrive to class late, or I suspect that you are not actively listening to the discussion (e.g., working on other assignments, doom scrolling) since this is disrespectful and potentially distracting. It is possible to earn a negative discussion credit score for the day.



## 2. Final Paper (50\%) 

You are expected to prepare an original research paper for this course. Your project should ask a succinct research question that can be answered within one semester with potential for expansion into a conference paper, academic publication, dissertation chapter, or thesis project. Your question can be descriptive or explanatory in nature (e.g., what vs. why), but your project must relate to some aspect of African politics, broadly defined. You may use either qualitative or quantitative research methods, or some combination of the two to answer your research question. Your choice of methods should be pragmatic and driven by the best available tools to answer your question.  There are several components of the project that we will complete in phases throughout the semester. More details are available here: [link to paper directions].  


| Deadline               | Assignment                        |

# Attendance Policy {#excuses}

Students are expected to attend all scheduled class meetings. A student may miss class only for good cause and must provide written documentation in advance or within **48 hours** of the missed class or as soon as physically possible.

Good cause for missing class, subject to the professor's discretion, may include:

* Sickness which disables the student from attending class or poses a significant threat to the health of others
* Sickness of, or accident involving, a spouse or dependent, that requires the student to be with the spouse or dependent
* An accident which necessarily prevents the student’s attendance in class 
* The death of a family member or friend
* An interview for an internship or a permanent position after graduation, if the interview cannot reasonably be scheduled to avoid a conflict
* A meeting or event at which the student must appear as a representative of the University (including official athletic events)
* Comprehensive exams, where the department schedules these to take place on the same day, one day before, or one day after the class meeting
* Jury duty on the same day as the class meeting
* Other good cause as is warranted under the circumstances 

Deadlines for other course assignments do not constitute a good cause for missing class. Extracurriculars (including Greek Life) are also not generally acceptable excuses for absences unless the student is acting as an official representative of the University (e.g., mock trial tournaments and official athletic events). 


## Excessive Absences ##

A student who is absent *for any reason* from the equivalent of three class meetings will only be allowed to continue with the course if they obtain approval from the professor. In such circumstances, the student will be marked as failing the course with an “F” letter grade unless they withdraw from the course before the final grading period.

--- 

# Grading Policies {#grades}


We will use the following grading scale in this class. Graduate students must maintain a 3.0 cumulative GPA or higher for all graduate coursework taken at the University of Alabama. A minimum 3.0 GPA is also required to be eligible for funding from the department.  This means that grades below a "B" in this course are considered inadequate or failing. 

| A (4.0)     |    B (3.0)  |     C (2.0)   |      D   (1.0) |  F   (0.0)      |
| :---------: |  :-------:  |  :----------: |  :------------:| :------------:
| 90-100\%    | 80-89\%     |  70-79\%      |  50-69\%       | 0-49% | 



## Missed Exams & Coursework {#late}

As a general rule, I do not accept late work. Deadlines on the [Course Schedule](schedule.html) are there to help ensure you successfully achieve the student learning objectives by the end of the semester. If you cannot meet a deadline or will need to miss an exam for a good cause, you must provide written documentation within  **48 hours** of the missed assignment or as soon as physically possible. 



## Grade Disputes {#disputes}

If you think I have made an error, contact me during office hours or schedule an appointment within one week of receiving the grade. Out of respect for your right to privacy under the University’s Confidentiality of Student Records policy and the Family Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, I do not discuss grades via email.



## Incomplete Grades {#incomplete}

Incomplete “I” grades will be recorded only in exceptional cases when: the student (a) has completed a substantial portion of the course and is otherwise passing, (b) is unable to complete a well-defined portion of a course for reasons beyond the student’s control, and (c) in the instructor’s judgement can complete the required work without repeating the course. 

Requests for "I" grades must be submitted in writing to the instructor, and the student must make arrangements to meet with the instructor before the final grading period to establish a contract for how and when they will complete the remaining coursework. A copy of the contract is available here: https://as.ua.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Incomplete-Grade-Agreement-Form.pdf 

In cases where “I” grades cause a student’s GPA to drop below 3.0, all “I” grades must be removed within the first four weeks of the next term of enrollment. If a student’s GPA remains below 3.0 after the removal of all “I” grades, the student will earn either Academic Suspension (dismissal) if they were admitted with Permission to Continue or Academic Warning if they were admitted via Regular Admission.

In cases where “I” grades do not cause a student’s GPA to drop below 3.0, all “I” grades must be removed by the end of the subsequent semester (excluding Summer), or the grade will be automatically converted to “F”. Faculty, with appropriate justification, may recommend that a longer completion window be granted to a student in unusual circumstances. In these cases, faculty must submit a petition to the Graduate Registrar before the end of the subsequent semester. The petition must outline the unusual circumstances and a plan for completing the remaining course requirements no later than 12 months from the end of the term in which the “I” grade was awarded, but before the student’s graduation.

# Plagiarism and AI 

In line with UA’s Academic Misconduct policy, I expect you to generate your own work in this course. By submitting an assignment, you claim this work is entirely your own. Any work that you have paraphrased should be correctly cited. If you use more than three words in a row from someone else’s work, use quotation marks and cite the source, including the page number. If you submit work generated by someone else or created by a computer application such as ChatGPT, this will be considered a violation of the Academic Misconduct policy and may be reported to the Department Chair or Dean’s office for review.

You may use word processing tools to check your spelling and grammar and assist with simple re-phrasing tasks. For example, I use the Grammarly application to help with my writing. It checks spelling and punctuation and sometimes provides advice on rephrasing sentences for clarity. This is a perfectly acceptable use of technology. However, having Grammarly’s AI assistant or similar tools write your work for you is unacceptable.

# Controversial Topics

Some of the topics in this course may be considered controversial. One of the core purposes of a university is to discuss important topics through a scholarly lens. When members of a class find themselves feeling strongly about a topic, that is a signal that the topic is important enough to be discussed rather than avoided. Differences of opinion are expected and will result in rich discussions. In these discussions students will be expected to demonstrate a thorough understanding of concepts presented in the course materials and to ground their positions in concepts and evidence relevant to the course. This in turn will entail coming to class prepared, asking relevant questions, sharing perspectives, having a willingness to listen, and practicing open-mindedness when encountering the perspectives of others. In this course we will assume the positive intentions of all class members when discussing important topics, and we will give them the benefit of the doubt when considering their perspectives and sharing our own. 

---  

# Other Policies

## Names and Pronouns 

UA provides instructors with a roster listing each student’s legal name. However, I will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise me accordingly early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records. You can also designate your pronouns in Banner.



## TurnItin Policy

Students agree that their enrollment in this course allows the instructor the right to use electronic devices to help prevent plagiarism. All course materials are subject to submission to Turnitin.com for the purpose of detecting textual similarities and plagiarism. 



## Audio/Video Recordings

This is an in-person discussion-based seminar. Therefore, as a general rule, no one is allowed to make audio or video recordings of our class sessions. This will facilitate an active, honest, open discussion during our meetings.  Any student violating this rule may be referred to the Office of Student Conduct for disciplinary action. Students with documented disabilities requiring access to audio recordings of missed classes should notify me formally through the ODS portal so that we can make alternative accommodations that are more reasonable for the course format.



## Sharing Course Materials

All course materials, presentations, and class discussions are only for viewing by members of this class section. They may not be posted in any public forum or shared with anyone not enrolled. Any student violating these rules may be referred to the Office of Student Conduct for disciplinary action.


## Academic Misconduct 

Students are expected to be familiar with and adhere to the official Academic Misconduct Policy provided in the Online Catalog. Any suspected academic misconduct, including plagiarism, will be referred to the College of Arts & Sciences Dean’s Office.  For more information: https://provost.ua.edu/academic-misconduct/ 
 

## Disability Accommodations

## Religious Observances

Under the Guidelines for Religious Holiday Observances, students should notify the instructor in writing or via email during the first two weeks of the semester of their intention to be absent from class for religious observance. The instructor will work to provide reasonable opportunity to complete academic responsibilities as long as that does not interfere with the academic integrity of the course. See full guidelines at Religious Holiday Observances Guidelines: https://provost.ua.edu/oaa-guidelines-for-religious-holidays-observance/ 




## UAct Ethical Community 

The University of Alabama is committed to an ethical, inclusive community defined by respect and civility. The UAct website (http://www.ua.edu/uact) provides extensive information on how to report or obtain assistance with a variety of issues, including issues related to dating violence, domestic violence, stalking, sexual assault, sexual violence or other Title IX violations, illegal discrimination, harassment, hate or bias incidents, child abuse or neglect, hazing, threat assessment, retaliation, and ethical violations or fraud.




## Severe Weather Protocol

The guiding principle at The University of Alabama is to promote the personal safety of our students, faculty, and staff during severe weather events. Please see the latest severe weather guidelines in the Online Catalog: www.ready.ua.edu/severe-weather-guidelines/. In particular, I recommend downloading the ABC-3340 weather app, following James Spann on social media, and activating emergency alerts on your mobile devices.




## Mandatory Reporting

As a faculty member at the University of Alabama, I am a mandatory reporter for known or suspected child abuse or neglect. This means that if I become aware of harm or threatened harm, sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, or negligent treatment of any person under the age of 18 or under the age of 19 in need of protective services, I must immediately report the suspected abuse to the University of Alabama Police Department. For more information:  https://uact.ua.edu/information/child-protection 



## Responsible Reporting

As a faculty member at the University of Alabama, I am considered a responsible reporting individual for sexual misconduct under Title IX regulations. This means that I am required to immediately report known incidents of sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating/domestic violence, and stalking to the Title IX Coordinator and the Designated Harassment Resource Person under the UAct program. For more information: https://uact.ua.edu/information/titleix
