<h1>Course Description</h1>
<p>One of the most important areas of research in political science
concerns the development of modern democracy. For most of recorded
history, human beings have lived under dictatorship. During the 20th
century, however, democracy swept the globe. While democracy is now a
“zeitgeist,” most regimes still fail to meet the minimum standards to be
labeled “democratic”. Likewise, many democracies are currently under
threat from illiberal and anti-pluralist forces. This semester, we will
tackle questions about what constitutes democracy and what explains
democratization. We will discuss core debates in the academic
literature, drawing on modern classics and newer works produced in the
last five years. These scholarly works are highly relevant not only to
scholars of democratization but to policymakers and practitioners.
Throughout this semester, you will also learn how to employ the
“structured focused comparison” method for case studies. This method
allows investigators to analyze historical processes in a systematic way
to draw meaningful conclusions about how institutional changes unfold.
The course content should be helpful for graduate students pursuing
academic careers and those contemplating more policy-oriented
professions.</p>

<h1>Student Learning Objectives</h1>
<p>By the end of the semester, you should be able to…</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Summarize the main arguments and findings in the scholarly
literature on democratization.</li>
<li>Synthesize the scholarly literature on democratization to identify
how different arguments and findings speak to one another.</li>
<li>Evaluate the current state of our knowledge about democratization to
identify limitations and new areas for research.</li>
<li>Apply the structured focused comparison approach to evaluate
processes of democratization and their divergent outcomes using
real-world cases.</li>

<h1>Course Requirements</h1>
<div id="discussion" class="section level2">
<h2>1. Class Discussion (50%)</h2>
<p>This is a seminar, not a lecture-based course. You are expected to
attend and participate in all scheduled class meetings. You should
arrive on time, having completed the assigned readings, and prepared to
summarize, synthesize, and evaluate the material. This means that you
need to actively engage with the required readings before class, asking
questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the research <em>question</em> guiding this work?</li>
<li>What <em>methods</em> are used to answer the research question?</li>
<li>What are the main findings or <em>conclusions</em> from this
research?</li>
<li>How does this research <em>relate</em> to other scholarly works in
the literature?</li>
<li>What are the core <em>contributions</em> of this work?</li>
<li>What are the <em>limitations</em> of this research?</li>
</ul>
<p>I strongly encourage you to prepare notes on the readings and bring
them to class.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion Questions</strong>: To facilitate class
discussions, you are required to submit at least two discussion
questions each week <strong>by 8am the day of class</strong>, which can
be of a conceptual, substantive, or critical nature. Generally, we will
follow that order but may deviate depending on the flow of the
discussion.</p>
<p><strong>Earning Discussion Credit</strong>: For each class session,
you can earn up to five points toward your class discussion grade. One
point is for submitting two well-formulated discussion questions by 8am,
and the other four are for active participation during the discussion.
You will not earn discussion credit for merely attending class. You may
also lose discussion credit if you arrive to class late, or I suspect
that you are not actively listening to the discussion (e.g., working on
other assignments, doom scrolling) since this is disrespectful and
potentially distracting. It is possible to earn a negative discussion
credit score for the day.</p>
</div>
<div id="final-paper-50" class="section level2">
<h2>2. Final Paper (50%)</h2>
<p>You will be assigned two cases to analyze for structured focused
comparison. This method for case study research uses the systematic
selection of cases and the application of a standard set of criteria to
evaluate the historical processes in each case to achieve the overall
research objective. Our research objective is to better understand
democratization. To do so, we will look at cases where political
liberalization did and did not produce a democratic transition. We will
focus on explaining “deviant” cases where the outcome we observed was
different from what we expected <em>a priori</em> by comparing them to
other cases that are similar or different. You will complete the project
in several stages, with feedback and opportunities for revisions
throughout. At the end of the semester, you will present your findings
to the class for comments and discussion. Here is a summary of the
deadlines, which can also be found in the Course Schedule.</p>

<div id="excuses" class="section level1">
<h1>Attendance Policy</h1>
<p>Students are expected to attend all scheduled class meetings. A
student may miss class only for good cause and must provide written
documentation in advance or within <strong>48 hours</strong> of the
missed class or as soon as physically possible.</p>
<p>Good cause for missing class, subject to the professor’s discretion,
may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sickness which disables the student from attending class or poses a
significant threat to the health of others</li>
<li>Sickness of, or accident involving, a spouse or dependent, that
requires the student to be with the spouse or dependent</li>
<li>An accident which necessarily prevents the student’s attendance in
class</li>
<li>The death of a family member or friend</li>
<li>An interview for an internship or a permanent position after
graduation, if the interview cannot reasonably be scheduled to avoid a
conflict</li>
<li>A meeting or event at which the student must appear as a
representative of the University (including official athletic
events)</li>
<li>Comprehensive exams, where the department schedules these to take
place on the same day, one day before, or one day after the class
meeting</li>
<li>Jury duty on the same day as the class meeting</li>
<li>Other good cause as is warranted under the circumstances</li>
</ul>
<p>Deadlines for other course assignments do not constitute a good cause
for missing class. Extracurriculars (including Greek Life) are also not
generally acceptable excuses for absences unless the student is acting
as an official representative of the University (e.g., mock trial
tournaments and official athletic events).</p>
<div id="excessive-absences" class="section level2">
<h2>Excessive Absences</h2>
<p>A student who is absent <em>for any reason</em> from the equivalent
of three class meetings will only be allowed to continue with the course
if they obtain approval from the professor. In such circumstances, the
student will be marked as failing the course with an “F” letter grade
unless they withdraw from the course before the final grading
period.</p>
<hr />
</div>
</div>
<div id="grades" class="section level1">
<h1>Grading Policies</h1>
<p>We will use the following grading scale in this class. Graduate
students must maintain a 3.0 cumulative GPA or higher for all graduate
coursework taken at the University of Alabama. A minimum 3.0 GPA is also
required to be eligible for funding from the department.</p>

<h2>Missed Exams &amp; Coursework</h2>
<p>As a general rule, I do not accept late work. Deadlines on the <a
href="schedule.html">Course Schedule</a> are there to help ensure you
successfully achieve the student learning objectives by the end of the
semester. If you cannot meet a deadline or will need to miss an exam for
a good cause, you must provide written documentation within <strong>48
hours</strong> of the missed assignment or as soon as physically
possible.</p>
</div>
<div id="disputes" class="section level2">
<h2>Grade Disputes</h2>
<p>If you think I have made an error, contact me during office hours or
schedule an appointment within one week of receiving the grade. Out of
respect for your right to privacy under the University’s Confidentiality
of Student Records policy and the Family Rights and Privacy Act of 1974,
I do not discuss grades via email.</p>
</div>
<div id="incomplete" class="section level2">
<h2>Incomplete Grades</h2>
<p>Incomplete “I” grades will be recorded only in exceptional cases
when: the student (a) has completed a substantial portion of the course
and is otherwise passing, (b) is unable to complete a well-defined
portion of a course for reasons beyond the student’s control, and (c) in
the instructor’s judgment can complete the required work without
repeating the course.</p>
<p>The University of Alabama policy requires all grades of “I” to be
removed no later than 12 months after the end of the term in which they
were awarded but prior to the student’s graduation or the grade of “I”
will be changed to an “F.” The “I” may not be used as a means to
re-enroll in a course during a subsequent semester. A grade of “I” may
not be used to satisfy a prerequisite requirement.</p>
<p>Requests for “I” grades must be submitted in writing to the
instructor using this form: <a
href="https://forms.gle/JWRZz87gmhyLmBdr9"
class="uri">https://forms.gle/JWRZz87gmhyLmBdr9</a>. Such requests can
be sent no earlier than 01 November 2023 (the last day to drop a course
with a “W”) and no later than 12:30pm on 11 December 2023 (the end of
the final exam period).</p>

<div id="plagiarism-and-ai-technology" class="section level1">
<h1>Plagiarism and AI Technology</h1>
<p>Learning to communicate your ideas effectively is an essential skill
for any career path you may eventually take after graduation. While AI
technology is exciting and offers opportunities to improve the
efficiency of our research and writing, misusing this technology has
negative consequences. Bots like ChatGPT are only accurate about 60-70%
of the time and have been known to fabricate information. Using these
tools to write your work for you is not only unethical, it renders you
invisible. Your voice matters! Don’t let an AI silence you.</p>
<p>In line with UA’s Academic Misconduct policy, I expect you to
generate your own work in this course. By submitting an assignment, you
claim this work is entirely your own. Any work that you have paraphrased
should be correctly cited. If you use more than three words in a row
from someone else’s work, use quotation marks and cite the source,
including the page number. We will use the American Political Science
Association’s (APSA) style manual to assist with this endeavor,
accessible here: <a href="https://connect.apsanet.org/stylemanual/"
class="uri">https://connect.apsanet.org/stylemanual/</a>.</p>
<p>If you submit work generated by someone else or created by a computer
application such as ChatGPT, this will be considered a violation of the
Academic Misconduct policy and may be reported to the Department Chair
or Dean’s office for review.</p>
<p>You may use word processing tools to check your spelling and grammar
and assist with simple re-phrasing tasks. For example, I use the
Grammarly application to help with my writing. It checks spelling and
punctuation and sometimes provides advice on rephrasing sentences for
clarity. This is a perfectly acceptable use of technology. However,
having Grammarly’s AI assistant or similar tools write your work for you
is unacceptable.</p>

<h1>Other Policies</h1>
<div id="names-and-pronouns" class="section level2">
<h2>Names and Pronouns</h2>
<p>UA provides instructors with a roster listing each student’s legal
name. However, I will gladly honor your request to address you by an
alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise me accordingly early in
the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records. You
can also designate your pronouns in Banner.</p>

<div id="turnitin-policy" class="section level2">
<h2>TurnItin Policy</h2>
<p>Students agree that their enrollment in this course allows the

Turnitin.com for the purpose of detecting textual similarities and
plagiarism.</p>
</div>
<div id="audiovideo-recordings" class="section level2">
<h2>Audio/Video Recordings</h2>
<p>This is an in-person discussion-based seminar. Therefore, as a
general rule, no one is allowed to make audio or video recordings of our
class sessions. This will facilitate an active, honest, open discussion
during our meetings. Any student violating this rule may be referred to
the Office of Student Conduct for disciplinary action. Students with
documented disabilities requiring access to audio recordings of missed
classes should notify me formally through the ODS portal so that we can
make alternative accommodations that are more reasonable for the course
format.</p>

<h2>Sharing Course Materials</h2>
<p>All course materials, presentations, and class discussions are only

violating these rules may be referred to the Office of Student Conduct
for disciplinary action.</p>
