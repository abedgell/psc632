<h1>Course Description</h1>
<p>Africa is a diverse continent made up of 54 countries and over 1.2
billion people. The land area of the Gambia is smaller than Connecticut,
whereas Algeria and D.R. Congo are both larger than Western Europe. With
over 200 million residents, Nigeria is home to nearly 3% of the world’s
population. Meanwhile, all the residents of Seychelles could fit inside
Bryant Denny Stadium (with room to spare!). The continent is often
depicted as an impoverished place. To some extent this is true –
currently, fifteen African countries have a GDP per capita (PPP) under
$2,000. At the same time, Botswana’s GDP per capita (PPP) is nearly
$2,000 higher than China’s. Africa is also home to all types of
political systems – this includes a thriving liberal democracy in Ghana,
an absolute monarchy in Eswatini, a military junta in Sudan, and a
one-party regime in Eritrea. This makes Africa an exciting place to
study comparative politics.</p>
<p>This course primarily focuses on contemporary political dynamics on
the African continent in the post-Cold War period. We will situate
studies about African cases within the broader debates of comparative
politics by focusing on several core research areas within the
sub-discipline. We will draw extensively from recently published books
and journal articles throughout the semester to learn about the latest
scholarship on African Politics.</p>

<h1>Student Learning Outcomes</h1>
<p>By the end of the semester, you should be able to…</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Summarize the main arguments and findings in the scholarly
literature on African Politics.</li>
<li>Synthesize the scholarly literature on African Politics to identify
how different arguments and findings speak to one another.</li>
<li>Evaluate the current state of our knowledge about African Politics
to identify limitations and new areas for research.</li>

<h1>Pre-requisites</h1>
<p>Graduate standing or admission into the Accelerated Masters Program

beyond U.S. media, I highly recommend that you also read the following
book before the semester begins:</p>

<h1>Course Requirements</h1>
<p></br></p>
<div id="discussion" class="section level3">
<h3>Class Discussion (50%)</h3>
<p>This is a seminar, not a lecture-based course. You are expected to
attend and participate in all scheduled class meetings. You should
arrive on time, having completed the assigned readings, and prepared to
summarize, synthesize, and evaluate the material. This means that you
need to actively engage with the required readings before class, asking
questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the research <em>question</em> guiding this work?</li>
<li>What <em>methods</em> are used to answer the research question?</li>
<li>What are the main findings or <em>conclusions</em> from this
research?</li>
<li>How does this research <em>relate</em> to other scholarly works in
the literature?</li>
<li>What are the core <em>contributions</em> of this work?</li>
<li>What are the <em>limitations</em> of this research?</li>
</ul>
<p>I strongly encourage you to prepare notes on the readings and bring
them to class. For each class session, you can earn up to five points
toward your class discussion grade:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Discussion Questions (1 point)</strong>: To facilitate
class discussions, you are required to submit at least two discussion
questions each week <strong>by 8am the day of class</strong> using
Microsoft Forms: <a href="https://forms.office.com/r/3yHSWMg0tH"
class="uri">https://forms.office.com/r/3yHSWMg0tH</a>. Your questions
should critically engage with and strive to build connections between
the assigned readings, both within individual weeks and across the
entire course. This means that you should prepare accordingly. Your
questions will be evaluated based on their quality and you will not earn
points for questions that lack sufficient depth or engagement with the
assigned materials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>In-Class Participation (4 points)</strong>: Active
participation during the discussion means that you are
<em>listening</em> and <em>engaging</em> with others. You will not earn
discussion credit for merely attending class. You may also lose
discussion credit if you arrive to class late, or I suspect that you are
not actively listening to the discussion (e.g., working on other
assignments, doom scrolling) since this is disrespectful and potentially
distracting. It is possible to earn a negative discussion credit score
for the day.</p></li>
</ul>
<p></br></p>
</div>
<div id="research-project-50" class="section level3">
<h3>Research Project (50%)</h3>
<p>All students are encouraged to complete an original research project
on a question related to African Politics, broadly defined. This
assignment is particularly relevant to students who plan to conduct
research on or related to the African continent for their MA thesis or
PhD dissertation. However, obtaining experience conducting research is
also important for students who may not be specializing in African
politics or comparative politics more generally. So, I encourage
everyone to pursue this track and will only make exceptions when a clear
case is made for why conducting research for this class will have no
direct benefit to you (see Final Exam Option below).</p>
<p>There are several components of the research project that we will
complete in phases throughout the semester. More details are available
in the <a href="papers.html">Paper Guidelines</a>. In general, your
project should ask a research question that can be answered within one
semester with potential for expansion into a conference paper, academic
publication, dissertation chapter, or thesis project. Your question can
be descriptive or explanatory in nature (e.g., what vs. why), but your
project must relate to some aspect of African politics. I define African
Politics broadly, and students may submit research on topics related to
various themes crossing subfields of political science and other related
disciplines. However, the research should be empirical in nature and
have a clearly defined question. Your choice of methods for answering
your research question should be pragmatic and practical, based on the
best available tools given the constraints of a semester-length
project.</p>
<p></br></p>
</div>
<div id="final-exam-option" class="section level3">
<h3>Final Exam Option</h3>
<p>With permission from the instructor, students may take a final exam
in lieu of conducting an original research project. Students wishing to
take the final exam must meet with me to obtain approval by 27 September
2024.</p>
<p>The final exam will consist of two essay questions similar to those
you would encounter for the MA or PhD comprehensive exams in political
science. You will have two hours to complete the exam during the
university-assigned exam period on 12 December from 10:30am to
12:30pm.</p>
<p>Before taking the final exam, you are required to meet one-on-one
with all faculty members in the department who specialize in your exam
fields. For political science MA students, this is your major field, and
for political science PhD students, this is both your major and minor
field. For students outside the department, we can discuss what this
requirement looks like depending on your department’s examination
standards. The purpose of these meetings is to discuss expectations for
comprehensive exams to help you prepare for this milestone. You must
submit a signed form documenting when you met with each professor and a
copy of your notes from each meeting by 06 December.</p>
<p>Before taking the final exam, you are also required to participate in
the end-of-semester research workshop, where students who conducted
research projects will present their work for feedback. This will be a
read-ahead style workshop. You are required to read all the papers in
advance and share your feedback during the workshop.</p>
<hr />
</div>
</div>
<div id="excuses" class="section level1">
<h1>Attendance Policy</h1>
<p>Students are expected to attend all scheduled class meetings. A
student may miss class only for good cause and must provide written
documentation in advance or within <strong>48 hours</strong> of the
missed class or as soon as physically possible.</p>
<p>Good cause for missing class, subject to the professor’s discretion,
may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sickness which disables the student from attending class or poses a
significant threat to the health of others</li>
<li>Sickness of, or accident involving, a spouse or dependent, that
requires the student to be with the spouse or dependent</li>
<li>An accident which necessarily prevents the student’s attendance in
class</li>
<li>The death of a family member or friend</li>
<li>An interview for an internship or a permanent position after
graduation, if the interview cannot reasonably be scheduled to avoid a
conflict</li>
<li>A meeting or event at which the student must appear as a
representative of the University (including official athletic
events)</li>
<li>Comprehensive exams, where the department schedules these to take
place on the same day, one day before, or one day after the class
meeting</li>
<li>Jury duty on the same day as the class meeting</li>
<li>Other good cause as is warranted under the circumstances</li>
</ul>
<p>Deadlines for other course assignments do not constitute a good cause
for missing class. Extracurriculars (including Greek Life) are also not
generally acceptable excuses for absences unless the student is acting
as an official representative of the University (e.g., mock trial
tournaments and official athletic events).</p>
<div id="excessive-absences" class="section level2">
<h2>Excessive Absences</h2>
<p>A student who is absent <em>for any reason</em> from the equivalent
of three class meetings will only be allowed to continue with the course
if they obtain approval from the professor. In such circumstances, the
student will be marked as failing the course with an “F” letter grade
unless they withdraw from the course before the final grading
period.</p>
<hr />
</div>
</div>
<div id="grades" class="section level1">
<h1>Grading Policies</h1>
<p>We will use the following grading scale in this class. Graduate
students must maintain a 3.0 cumulative GPA or higher for all graduate
coursework taken at the University of Alabama. A minimum 3.0 GPA is also
required to be eligible for funding from the department. This means that
grades below a “B” in this course are considered inadequate or
failing.</p>

<h2>Missed Exams &amp; Coursework</h2>
<p>As a general rule, I do not accept late work. Deadlines on the <a
href="schedule.html">Course Schedule</a> are there to help ensure you
successfully achieve the student learning objectives by the end of the
semester. If you cannot meet a deadline or will need to miss an exam for
a good cause, you must provide written documentation within <strong>48
hours</strong> of the missed assignment or as soon as physically
possible.</p>
</div>
<div id="disputes" class="section level2">
<h2>Grade Disputes</h2>
<p>If you think I have made an error, contact me during office hours or
schedule an appointment within one week of receiving the grade. Out of
respect for your right to privacy under the University’s Confidentiality
of Student Records policy and the Family Rights and Privacy Act of 1974,
I do not discuss grades via email.</p>
</div>
<div id="incomplete" class="section level2">
<h2>Incomplete Grades</h2>
<p>Incomplete “I” grades will be recorded only in exceptional cases
when: the student (a) has completed a substantial portion of the course
and is otherwise passing, (b) is unable to complete a well-defined
portion of a course for reasons beyond the student’s control, and (c) in
the instructor’s judgement can complete the required work without
repeating the course.</p>
<p>Requests for “I” grades must be submitted in writing to the
instructor, and the student must make arrangements to meet with the
instructor before the final grading period to establish a contract for
how and when they will complete the remaining coursework. A copy of the
contract is available here: <a
href="https://as.ua.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Incomplete-Grade-Agreement-Form.pdf"
class="uri">https://as.ua.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Incomplete-Grade-Agreement-Form.pdf</a></p>
<p>In cases where “I” grades cause a student’s GPA to drop below 3.0,
all “I” grades must be removed within the first four weeks of the next
term of enrollment. If a student’s GPA remains below 3.0 after the
removal of all “I” grades, the student will earn either Academic
Suspension (dismissal) if they were admitted with Permission to Continue
or Academic Warning if they were admitted via Regular Admission.</p>
<p>In cases where “I” grades do not cause a student’s GPA to drop below
3.0, all “I” grades must be removed by the end of the subsequent
semester (excluding Summer), or the grade will be automatically
converted to “F”. Faculty, with appropriate justification, may recommend
that a longer completion window be granted to a student in unusual
circumstances. In these cases, faculty must submit a petition to the
Graduate Registrar before the end of the subsequent semester. The
petition must outline the unusual circumstances and a plan for
completing the remaining course requirements no later than 12 months
from the end of the term in which the “I” grade was awarded, but before
the student’s graduation.</p>

<div id="plagiarism-and-ai" class="section level1">
<h1>Plagiarism and AI</h1>
<p>In line with UA’s Academic Misconduct policy, I expect you to
generate your own work in this course. By submitting an assignment, you
claim this work is entirely your own. Any work that you have paraphrased
should be correctly cited. If you use more than three words in a row
from someone else’s work, use quotation marks and cite the source,
including the page number. If you submit work generated by someone else
or created by a computer application such as ChatGPT, this will be
considered a violation of the Academic Misconduct policy and may be
reported to the Department Chair or Dean’s office for review.</p>
<p>You may use word processing tools to check your spelling and grammar
and assist with simple re-phrasing tasks. For example, I use the
Grammarly application to help with my writing. It checks spelling and
punctuation and sometimes provides advice on rephrasing sentences for
clarity. This is a perfectly acceptable use of technology. However,
having Grammarly’s AI assistant or similar tools write your work for you
is unacceptable.</p>

<h1>Other Policies</h1>
<div id="respectful-dialogue" class="section level2">
<h2>Respectful Dialogue</h2>
<p>The classroom should be a welcoming and safe environment for everyone
to learn from our diverse views and experiences. At times, we may
discuss topics with several possible viewpoints that may seem
controversial or stir an intense emotional response from the class. Our
goal in discussing these topics is the pursuit of knowledge, which often
involves complex normative and subjective ideas. You do not have to
agree with others’ opinions, but you are expected to show respect for
one another by actively listening and refraining from personal attacks
or demeaning comments.</p>
</div>
<div id="names-and-pronouns" class="section level2">
<h2>Names and Pronouns</h2>
<p>UA provides instructors with a roster listing each student’s legal
name. However, I will gladly honor your request to address you by an
alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise me accordingly early in
the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records. You
can also designate your pronouns in Banner.</p>

the Office of Student Conduct for disciplinary action. Students with
documented disabilities requiring access to audio recordings of missed
classes should notify me formally through the ODS portal so that we can
make alternative accommodations that are more reasonable for the course
format.</p>
