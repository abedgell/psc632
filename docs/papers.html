<h1>Research Project Guidelines</h1>
<p>You are expected to conduct original research and prepare an original
research paper for this course.</p>
<p>Your project should ask a succinct research question that can be
answered within one semester with the potential for revision into a
conference paper, academic publication, dissertation chapter, or thesis
project. Your question can be descriptive or explanatory in nature
(e.g., what vs. why), but your project must relate to some aspect of
African politics, broadly defined.</p>
<p>You may use either qualitative or quantitative research methods or
some combination of the two to answer your research question. Your
choice of methods should be pragmatic and practical, driven by the best
available tools to answer your question within the semester.</p>
<p>There are several components of the project that we will complete in
phases throughout the semester, as summarized in the table below. This
document provides detailed guidelines and tips that will help you
develop your project and prepare your final paper.</p>

<h2>Mandatory Consultations</h2>
<p>There are three mandatory one-on-one consultations throughout the
semester. The dates on the schedule are the deadlines; however, I
encourage you to meet with me as early and as often as you like, either
in office hours or by appointment.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Consultation 1 (no later than 27 September)</strong>: In
this meeting, you will pitch to me your project idea and get early
feedback on whether it sounds feasible. You should come prepared with a
preliminary research question and ready to justify why you think it is
important. You should also have some ideas for how you would answer your
question within the semester.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Consultation 2 (no later than 18 October)</strong>: This
meeting is designed to give you additional feedback on your project
proposal. You should come prepared to address the questions and issues I
raised and bring any questions you have about my feedback.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Consultation 3 (no later than 06 December)</strong>: This
meeting is for feedback on your final paper draft. You should come
prepared to address the questions and issues I raised and bring any
questions you have about my feedback.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="formatting-guidelines" class="section level2">
<h2>Formatting Guidelines</h2>
<p>Research proposals and papers should be formatted using the style
guidelines of the <a
href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/african-studies-review/information/author-instructions/preparing-your-materials"><em>African
Studies Review</em></a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<strong>Why this particular formatting style?</strong>
</p>
<p>The goal for this assignment is for you to walk away with a high
quality paper that you will be able to use for conference presentations
and potentially a publication. This may also be a jumping off point for
a chapter that you will revise for your dissertation at some later date.
At the very least, I hope that you will produce a very good writing
sample for future job or academic applications.</p>
<p>With these goals in mind, I encourage you to already be thinking
about where you would like to present (and eventually, publish) this
research. I will periodically share opportunities, but one major
upcoming venue is the <a href="https://africanstudies.org">African
Studies Association</a>, which will hold its annual meeting in Atlanta
in November 2025.</p>
<p>The ASA has an annual award for the best graduate student paper,
which comes with a fast-track to publication at the <em>African Studies
Review</em>. By making you format you paper now using the ASR
guidelines, you’ll save time later when you submit your paper for the
award and publication!</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone may decide to attend ASA or submit their
paper to the ASR. Nevertheless, learning how to follow the often
cumbersome formatting rules of a real academic journal is valuable for
all those who may one day submit something for publication.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="guidelines-for-proposals" class="section level2">
<h2>Guidelines for Proposals</h2>
<p>Your research proposal should be no longer than <strong>1,500
words</strong>, excluding the references. It should cover the
following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman">
<li><p><strong>Research Question</strong>: Clearly state the research
question. Elaborate as necessary.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Literature and Motivation</strong>: Provide a brief
summary of the literature and explain why your proposed research is
important. At this point, you should have completed your review of the
literature. This section should be a draft of your literature review for
the final paper.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Proposed Methods</strong>: Explain the methods you
propose to use to answer your research question. Be specific. Discuss
sources of data, case selection, and tools you will use to analyze the
data. Justify your method and discuss why alternative approaches are not
a good fit for your project.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Anticipated Findings</strong>: Discuss what you
anticipate to conclude from the research. Be specific about what you
think you will find.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>References</strong>: Provide a list of references used in
your proposal and others you think you will use in your
project.</p></li>
</ol>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="guidelines-for-final-paper" class="section level2">
<h2>Guidelines for Final Paper</h2>
<p>Final research papers should be written in an accessible style and
follow the general conventions of political science scholarship. Papers
should not exceed <strong>9,000 words</strong> and may be considerably
shorter, depending on the project. The word limit does not include the
reference list or appendices.</p>
<p>In general, I suggest that you choose a well-written article related
to your research question and try to emulate the structure of that paper
when writing your own. I say this because the structure varies depending
on the underlying research question and methodology. Most empirical
articles include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman">
<li><p><strong>Introduction</strong>: What is this paper about?
Introduce the main research question and motivation. Explain why the
research is important, situating this within the literature. Then
discuss briefly your methods and preview your findings. Most
introductions also include a final paragraph that gives an overview of
the rest of the paper.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Literature Review and Theory</strong>: This section tells
the story of what we already know from the literature. It should take
time to define the core concepts and then draw core lessons from the
literature, highlighting limitations or gaps. It should also clearly
state how this paper builds upon the existing literature by proposing a
new theory or re-evaluating existing theories.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Methods</strong>: This section will explain your research
design and methods. You should clearly articulate the universe of cases
and how you selected your sample for analysis. You should also describe
in detail how you conducted your analysis, such as which tools you used
for collecting data, organizing it, and evaluating it. For quantitative
studies, this naturally means discussing the variables you used,
including their sources, and the estimation strategies you adopted
(e.g., multivariate regression). For qualitative studies, the task is
often more difficult. Historical case studies will require careful
discussion of case selection and how you collecting material on your
case, particularly how you evaluated the credibility of sources and
mitigated biases. Other qualitative methods, for example, include
structured-focused comparisons, process tracing, and qualitative content
analysis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Findings</strong>: This section outlines the main
findings from the research. You should be clear here the extent to which
the findings support your theory and the existing theories in the
literature. The structure for this section varies a lot depending on
methods. For example, quantitative studies will usually provide tables
and figures, discussing what these mean. Qualitative studies might
include lengthy historical descriptions of events within cases or
thematic discussions of findings across several cases.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This section recaps the main
findings of the paper and its contribution to the literature. Afterward,
you should mention the limitations of the study and future research that
could build upon it by answering unanswered questions or perhaps
directly addressing causal mechanisms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>References</strong>: Provide a list of all sources
referenced in your paper. For this section, I recommend that you adopt
some sort of reference management software.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Appendix</strong>: This section includes additional
information such as robustness checks, alternative cases, lists of
materials consulted, and more technical discussions of methods. You’ll
use this to supplement information in the main text as needed to keep
your paper to a reasonable length.</p></li>

<div id="final-papers-workshop" class="section level2">
<h2>Final Papers Workshop</h2>
<p>We will hold a read-ahead style workshop for the final papers on
<strong>02 December 2024</strong> during our final class session. This
workshop includes two assignments:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>You should read the other students’ papers and bring feedback for
them to the class session.</p></li>
<li><p>You should prepare a 10-12 minute presentation of your paper.
Your presentation should give a brief overview of the project, including
the research question, motivation, literature/theory, and
findings.</p></li>

<h2>Additonal Guidance and Tips</h2>
<p></br></p>
<div id="research-questions" class="section level3">
<h3>Research Questions</h3>
<p>What empirical puzzle do you hope to answer with this project? Are
you interested in describing or explaining something? Both are
acceptable forms of inference, despite the latter’s preferential
treatment (see Gerring, J. 2012. “Mere description.” British Journal of
Political Science, 42(4): 721-46).</p>
<p>In general, your question should be formulated around a real-world
phenomenon, not the operationalization of that phenomenon, unless you
are interested in exploring questions about measurement.</p>
<p>Examples of <strong>incorrectly phrased questions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why does the ACLED data on protests vary across African regions as
defined by the United Nations?</li>
<li>Does AidData correlate with lower Political Terror Scale scores in
Africa?</li>
<li>Do PolityIV scores predict corruption scores by Transparency
International?</li>
<li>Does the number of multiparty presidential elections correlate with
lower Freedom House Civil Liberties scores in Africa?</li>
<li>Is Geddes et al. (2014) or Regimes of the World better for
predicting authoritarian breakdown in Africa?</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of <strong>correctly phrased questions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why do some African regions experience comparatively higher rates of
social mobilization?</li>
<li>Does foreign aid reduce human rights abuses in Africa?</li>
<li>How does democracy affect perceived corruption levels?</li>
<li>Does electoral experience entrench or subvert democracy in
Africa?</li>
<li>How does our conceptualization of authoritarian regimes in Africa
affect the answers we get to questions about authoritarian resilience
and breakdown?</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have your research question, you should break it down into
the central concepts you are interested in studying. Think of these as
your research topic(s) or keywords. For the correctly phrased questions
above, the central concepts are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social mobilization and geopolitical regions in Africa</li>
<li>Foreign aid and human rights abuses</li>
<li>Democracy and corruption perceptions</li>
<li>Electoral experience and democracy</li>
<li>Authoritarian regimes, authoritarian resilience, and authoritarian
breakdown</li>
</ul>
<p></br></p>
</div>
<div id="the-literature-review" class="section level3">
<h3>The Literature Review</h3>
<p>Once you’ve defined your question and isolated your central concepts,
you should conduct a thorough review of the literature. This serves two
main purposes:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>How do we define the central concepts in your
study?</strong><br />
You need to understand what your concepts mean in practice and how we
can measure them. You should scour the academic and policy literature to
come up with your preferred definition of each concept and preferred
method for measuring it. You should also keep track of competing
definitions and measures, so that you can discuss these in your paper
and potentially address the through robustness tests.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Why is answering this question important?</strong><br />
You should situate your research puzzle within ongoing debates in the
literature or as a practical policy solution. As part of your literature
review, you should seek answers to the following questions: What do we
already know? Has your research question been studied previously? What
did those studies find? What are the limitations of our existing
knowledge of the research question and related concepts? How will your
study contribute to the ongoing discussions in the literature by
extending or building upon previous findings or opening up new pathways
of research on the central concepts beyond what we already know? At the
end of this process, you should be able to explain what important
academic and/or policy-relevant outcomes will come from your research.
In other words, why is this research worth your time, and why should
others care about it?</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>General Tips for Conducting a Literature Review:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start with reliable databases of academic journal articles.
Google Scholar is good but often includes <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predatory_publishing">‘predatory
journals’</a>, so be sure to verify that the source is reliable. Other
tools that are useful include <a
href="https://www.researchrabbitapp.com">Research Rabbit</a> and the UA
library’s website.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the library to locate books. Search Scout for related books.
Make a list of the call numbers and then go to the library to find these
in the stacks. The library organizes books around themes, so there will
be other related books nearby. This is a great way to find things that
you may not have found otherwise.</p></li>
<li><p>Snowball. Start with a publication that closely matches your
research topic. If you can find a review article, that’s even better.
Then read backward and forward in the literature, reviewing earlier
publications that are cited in the article and later publications that
cited the article. For each new article, do the same forward and
backward reviewing until you reach a staturation point.</p></li>
<li><p>Stay organized. Keep a running list of all works you have found
relevant to your topic. I use a <a
href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OntjN_N0MJ949hbvhvCViMbaAQi9rEv27h7H41NMusc/edit?usp=sharing">spreadsheet</a>
and fill in the information as I review each work. Alternatively, you
could keeping a running <a
href="https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/common_writing_assignments/annotated_bibliographies/annotated_bibliography_samples.html">annotated
bibliography</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Look for broad themes. The goal here is to create a story from
the literature. Your written literature review section in the final
paper should weave together the main arguments and findings in the
literature. Some ways to do this are to cluster around themes, methods,
or approaches. You want to zoom out and plug in individual works as they
fit into the story. You do not want to focus on the trees and miss the
forest. In other words, avoid the “beads-on-a-string” approach that
simply defaults to an annotated bibliography as the literature
review.</p></li>
<li><p>Leverage technology but don’t let it do the work for you. <a
href="https://claude.ai">Claude</a> and <a
href="https://consensus.app">Consensus</a> are two helpful AI tools for
summarizing academic literature. However, as with any AI model, they can
make mistakes. You may use these tools to help you locate sources and

<h3>A Note About Methods</h3>
<p>How will you answer your question? What sources of data will you draw
upon? Will you use a single case study, comparative cases, or
cross-national data? Will you use qualitative or quantitative methods?
Why is this method appropriate for answering your question, both from a
utility and practical sense?</p>
<p>I do not have a preference for qualitative or quantitative methods.
My training is pluralistic and my approach to methodology is pragmatic.
What is the best method for answering the question, both in terms of
rigor and practicality? I expect that some students in this class will
pursue quantitative observational analyses while others will employ
qualitative case studies. The choice is really about your research
question, what you are comfortable with, and what you are able to do
within the time constraints of the course.</p>
<p>During our individual consultations, we can discuss methodology and
ways to go about choosing the best approach for your paper. We can
discuss available sources of data, case selection, and further readings
on methodology that will help guide your study.</p>
