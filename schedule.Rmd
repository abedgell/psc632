**Topic: Problems of Democratic Transition ** 

This week we'll read a substantial portion of the book *Problems of Democratic Transition and Consolidation* by Juan J. Linz and Alfred Stepan. In addition to reading the first part of the book, which sets up their theory, you will be assigned to read one of the case study chapters. During our discussion, you will inform the rest of the class about your case and how it fits within the theory. In addition, you should research how your case has fared since the publication of Linz and Stepan. Has it “consolidated” as a democracy? Did it “backslide” into authoritarianism?

Work on your structured focused comparisons. Timelines for both cases and a draft reference list are both due by 03 October 2023 at 11:59pm.

## 10 October 2023 

**Topic: "Modernization" Theory**

Does development cause democratization? Are there long-run processes of human *evolution* that eventually lead from traditional societies to modern, democratic, and capitalistic ones? This week we evaluate the “modernization” theory, assessing the evidence for and against its claims. Afterward, we will discuss the political factors that gave rise to this theory and why it “never dies.”

## 31 October 2023

**Topic: Institutional Dimensions**

Institutions and their legacies play an essential role in the literature on democratization. This week we look at some of the institutions under authoritarianism – such as elections, parties, and legislatures – and the overall organization of the regime to evaluate whether these matter and whether they help or hinder democratization.

## 07 November 2023

</br>

## 14 November 2023

**Topic: Bringing it Together**

This week, we will consider a metatheory of democratization primarily influenced by structural factors. We’ll then compare this argument to recent claims that democratization might be a “mistake.” As we discuss these works, we should carefully consider how they fit within the other readings throughout the course to draw some general conclusions about what we know about democratization after over 60 years of empirical research.
