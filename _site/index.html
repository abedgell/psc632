<h1>Course Description</h1>
<p>One of the most important areas of research in political science
concerns the development of modern democracy. For most of recorded
history, human beings have lived under dictatorship. During the 20th
century, however, democracy swept the globe. While democracy is now a
“zeitgeist”, most regimes still fail to meet the minimal standards to be
labeled “democratic”. Likewise, many democracies are currently under
threat from illiberal and anti-pluralist forces. Throughout this
semester, we will tackle questions about what constitutes democracy and
what explains democratization. We will discuss some of the core debates
in the academic literature, drawing on both modern classics and newer
works produced in the last five years. These academic works are highly
relevant, not only to scholars of democratization, but to policymakers
and practitioners. Therefore, the course content should be useful for
graduate students interested in pursuing academic careers and those
contemplating more policy-practitioner oriented professions.</p>

<h1>Course Requirements</h1>
<div id="discussion" class="section level2">
<h2>1. Class Discussion (50%)</h2>
<p>This is a seminar, not a lecture-based course. You are expected to
attend and participate all scheduled class meetings. You should arrive
on time, having completed the assigned readings, and prepared to
summarize, synthesize, and evaluate the material. This means that you
need to actively engage with the required readings before class, asking
questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the research <em>question</em> guiding this work?</li>
<li>What <em>methods</em> are used to answer the research question?</li>
<li>What are the main findings or <em>conclusions</em> from this
research?</li>
<li>How does this research <em>relate</em> to other scholarly works in
the literature?</li>
<li>What are the core <em>contributions</em> of this work?</li>
<li>What are the <em>limitations</em> of this research?</li>
</ul>
<p>I strongly encourage you to prepare notes on the readings and bring
them with you to class.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion Questions</strong>: To facilitate class
discussions, you are required to submit at least two discussion
questions each week, <strong>no later 8am the day of class</strong>,
which can be of a conceptual, substantive, or critical nature.
Generally, we will follow that order, but may deviate depending on the
flow of the discussion.</p>
<p><strong>Earning Discussion Credit</strong>: For each class session,
you can earn up to five points toward your class discussion grade. One
point is for submitting two well-formulated discussion questions by 8am
and the other four are for active participation during the discussion.
You will not earn discussion credit for merely attending class. You may
also lose discussion credit if you arrive to class late or I suspect
that you are not actively listening to the discussion (e.g. working on
other assignments, doom scrolling) since this is disrespectful and
potentially distracting. It is possible to earn a negative discussion
credit score for the day.</p>
</div>
<div id="exam" class="section level2">
<h2>2. Final Exam or Project (50%)</h2>
<p><strong>For Students who will take the comparative politics
comprehensive exam</strong></p>
<p>To help you prepare for comprehensive exams, you will take a final
exam covering the content of this course. During the exam, you may use
your notes and access course readings to prepare your responses;
however, the use of pre-prepared responses and AI technoloogy are
strictly prohibited. I will grade you exam based on your demonstrated
ability to (1) summarize the readings; (2) synthesize across the
readings; and (3) evaluate and critique the readings, such as by
discussing the limitations, problems in the research design, or flaws in
the core argument. These are the same criteria the comparative politics
faculty uses when evaluating comprehensive exam responses. There will be
one opportunity to complete a practice exam around the midterm. Students
on the Exam Track may optionally complete this practice exam for
feedback from the professor. If a student fails the final exam, they
will have one opportunity to re-take it during the university scheduled
final exam period.</p>
<p><strong>Students who have already taken or will not take the
comparative politics comprehensive exam</strong></p>
<p>You will conduct a research project. Your project may either be an
original research paper, a research proposal, or a policy brief. The
project should be related to democratization (broadly defined) and fit
within your research or policy interests. Original papers can serve as
starting points for article manuscripts, dissertation or thesis
chapters, conference presentations, and writing samples. Research
proposals will help you refine an idea and get feedback on it, which can
be used for a dissertation or thesis prospectus. Policy briefs will
provide those interested in policy-oriented careers a chance to engage
with the policy implications of the academic work we read throughout the
course and develop a viable writing sample for job applications. You
will receive more detailed instructions about this assignment on the
first day of class.</p>
<hr />
</div>
</div>
<div id="grades" class="section level1">
<h1>Grading Policies</h1>
<p>We will use the following grading scale in this class. Graduate
students must maintain a 3.0 cumulative GPA or higher for all graduate
coursework taken at the University of Alabama. A minimum 3.0 GPA is also
required to be eligible for funding from the department.</p>
<table>

</table>
<div id="excuses" class="section level2">
<h2>Attendance</h2>
<p>Students are expected to attend all scheduled class meetings. A
student may miss class only for good cause, and in such cases must
provide written documentation in advance or within <strong>48
hours</strong> of the missed class. If the circumstances make this
impossible, documentation should be provided as soon as physically
possible.</p>
<p>Good cause for missing class, subject to the professor’s discretion,
may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sickness which disables the student from attending class or poses a
significant threat to the health of others</li>
<li>sickness of, or accident involving, a spouse or dependent, which
requires the student to be with the spouse or dependent</li>
<li>An accident which necessarily prevents the student’s attendance in
class</li>
<li>The death of a family member or friend</li>
<li>An interview for an internship or for a permanent position after
graduation, if the interview cannot reasonably be scheduled to avoid
conflict</li>
<li>A meeting or event at which the student must appear as a
representative of the University (including official athletic
events)</li>
<li>Comprehensive exams, where these are scheduled by the department to
take place on the same day, one day before, or one day after the class
meeting</li>
<li>Jury duty where this falls on the same day as the class meeting</li>
<li>Other good cause as is warranted under the circumstances</li>
</ul>
<p>Deadlines for other course assignments do not constitute good cause
for missing class. Extracurriculars (including Greek Life) are also not
generally acceptable excuses for absences, unless the student is acting
as an official representative of the University (e.g. mock trial
tournaments and official athletic events).</p>
</div>
<div id="excessive-absences" class="section level2">
<h2>Excessive Absences</h2>
<p>A student who is absent <em>for any reason</em> from the equivalent
of three class meetings will not be allowed to continue with the course
unless they obtain approval from the professor. In such circumstances,
the student will be marked as failing the course with an “F” letter
grade unless they withdraw from the course before the final grading
period.</p>
</div>
<div id="late" class="section level2">
<h2>Missed Exams &amp; Coursework</h2>
<p>As a general rule, I do not accept late work. Deadlines on the <a
href="#schedule">Course Schedule</a> are there to help ensure you
successfully achieve the student learning objectives by the end of the
semester. If you are unable to meet a deadline or will need to miss an
exam for good cause (see list under <a href="#absences">Missed
Classes</a>), you must provide written documentation in advance or
within <strong>48 hours</strong> of the missed assignment. If the
circumstances make this impossible, documentation should be provided as
soon as physically possible.</p>
</div>
<div id="disputes" class="section level2">
<h2>Grade Disputes</h2>
<p>If you think I have made an error, contact me during office hours or
schedule an appointment within one week of receiving the grade. Out of
respect for your right to privacy under the University’s Confidentiality
of Student Records policy and the Family Rights and Privacy Act of 1974,
I do not discuss grades via email.</p>
</div>
<div id="incomplete" class="section level2">
<h2>Incomplete Grades</h2>
<p>Incomplete “I” grades will be recorded only in exceptional cases
when: the student (a) has completed a substantial portion of the course
and is otherwise passing, (b) is unable to complete a well-defined
portion of a course for reasons beyond the student’s control, and (c) in
the instructor’s judgement can complete the required work without
repeating the course.</p>
<p>Requests for “I” grades must be submitted in writing to the
instructor using this form: <a
href="https://forms.gle/JWRZz87gmhyLmBdr9"
class="uri">https://forms.gle/JWRZz87gmhyLmBdr9</a>. These should be
submitted no earlier than 01 November 2023 (the last day to drop a
course with a “W”) and no later than the end of the final exam period,
which is 12:30pm on 11 December 2023.</p>
<p>The University of Alabama policy requires all grades of “I” to be
removed no later than 12 months after the end of the term in which they
were awarded but prior to the student’s graduation or the grade of “I”
will be changed to an “F.” The “I” may not be used as a means to
re-enroll in a course during a subsequent semester. A grade of “I” may
not be used to satisfy a prerequisite requirement.</p>

<h2>19 September 2023</h2>
<p><strong>Topic: Problems of Democratic Transition </strong></p>
<p>This week we’ll read a substantial portion of the book <em>Problems
of Democratic Transition and Consolidation</em> by Juan J. Linz and
Alfred Stepan. In addition to reading the first part of the book, which
sets up their theory, you will be assigned to read one of the case study
chapters. During our discussion, you will provide the rest of the class
with information on your case and how it fits within the theory. In
addition, you should conduct some research on how your case has fared
since the publication of Linz and Stepan. Has it “consolidated” as a
democracy? Did it “backslide” into authoritarianism?</p>

evaluate the “modernization” theory, assessing the evidence for and

<p>For our final discussion, we will consider a metatheory
democratization, primarily influenced by structural factors. We’ll then
compare this argument to recent claims that democratization might simply
be a “mistake”. As we discuss these works, we should pay careful
attention to how they fit within the other readings throughout the
course to draw some general conclusions about what we know about
democratization after over 60 years of empirical research.</p>
